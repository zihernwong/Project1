The Biography of Cee-Es
Beginning:
On an ominous Friday, September 13th, a little baby boy named Cee-Es was born. His parents Steve and Lena were both programmers for Apple.
As soon as Cee-Es came out of his mother's womb, his eyes were clearly out of sync. To fix this, he had eye surgery which went successful.
Approaching the age of 1, Cee-Es began looking at computers and watching Peppa Pig. At the age of two, Cee-Es started to learn Java. 
He picked up loops rather quickly but polymorphism and recursion proved to be a problem. Some nights he cried while doing his projects
provided by his parents, but it was all worth it as he began to master the language of Java. By the age of 4, he was ready for another 
challenge: Python.
